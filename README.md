Some parts of this code were inspired by 2016-2019 Udacity, Inc course.

1. Develop a comprehensive pipeline for lane line detection in image
2. Create a customized edge detection algorithm to identify edges in grayscale images.
3. Write code to read image frames, implement the lane detection pipeline on the captured frames, and integrate the detected lines into the video frame by frame.1.
